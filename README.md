[1] Attack A: Sends authentication frames to all APs found in range. Too many clients can freeze or reset several APs.

[2] Attack B: Sends beacon frames to show fake APs at clients. This can sometimes crash network scanners and even drivers!

[3] Attack C: Reworked WiFi-jammer (Crash all networks around you)

[4] Attack D: Sends deauthentication and disassociation packets to stations based on data traffic to disconnect all clients from an AP.

[5] Attack E: Crashes the certain WiFi network
